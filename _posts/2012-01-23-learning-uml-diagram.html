<p>Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of object-oriented software engineering. The standard is managed, and was created, by the Object Management Group. It was first added to the list of OMG adopted technologies in 1997, and has since become the industry standard for modeling software-intensive systems.</p>

<p>UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems.</p>
